1,"If 5G becomes unlimited in the future, it will be useful. If speed is provided according to the price, then it should be less",youtube,1,Airtel
2,They might bring unlimited internet plans with around ₹999/- per month charges or so! The price might be much higher than that too... but they may bring unlimited plans!,youtube,1,Airtel
3,"My 5G experience on Nothing Phone1 (Jio True5G):
In the main city: 1.5Gbps
On my roof (in the outskirts): 800Mbps
In the hall: 300Mbps
In the room: 100Mbps
Earlier, 4G didn't even give 10Mbps, no matter where I went.",youtube,1,Airtel
4,"Root your phone and then set Jio 5G band to Band 28 only. Whether you're in bed or in your room, you'll get 300 Mbps++ speed. You might lose 1-2 towers, but the speed will always remain high.""",youtube,1,Airtel
5,"I did a trip across a few states recently. I enjoyed 5G on Jio wherever it was available. The issue is still that of coverage. While on the train, the signal was okay for voice, but data speeds and stability were poor. The operators need to work on this. Also, for me, the slightly frustrating part is that the towers near my house haven't been upgraded yet, so I need to travel about half a kilometer to get 5G. Anyway, the WiFi at home is solid.",youtube,1,Airtel
6,Youtubers living in Tier 1 cities take WiFi for granted. Most people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities still rely on mobile data and mobile hotspots to fulfill their internet needs. 5G is like a boon for these people. They can work from home using their 5G mobile data instead of waiting for Jio and Airtel to install fiber cables in the city.,youtube,1,Airtel
7,"Most Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities now have broadband connections. Only villages are lagging in fiber connectivity, and that too not for long. There is no reason why one would prefer 5G over a fiber connection.",youtube,-1,Airtel
8,I think you don’t follow the latest trends. I live in a Tier 2 city and have had fiber connectivity here for the last 5 years. Now only villages are left to be connected.,youtube,1,Airtel
9,"Chirag and the Chinese are right. Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities have fiber available. But, but... what do they know about where fiber is available in villages... In villages, people rely on mobile internet. Most people in my village use Jio SIMs, which is why Jio’s speed sometimes drops. If Jio 5G is launched in villages, we will get amazing speed_x000D_
Bro, please upload videos in 4K quality now. I watch all YouTube videos in 4K as I have Jio True 5G. You should move with the times and start uploading videos in 4K.",youtube,1,Airtel
10,"You’re right. My phone doesn’t support 4K playback, but my TV does, and that’s why I have premium subscriptions for both Hotstar and Netflix. Although 4K on YouTube is compressed, watching 4K content on YouTube with jio 5g  is good",youtube,1,Airtel

14,"The Kolkata Book Fair was going on until last Sunday, and I couldn’t get any speeds with Jio’s 4G connection at that place. But thanks to 5G, I was able to access the internet because that place was packed with people, so 4G was just useless there  while 5G was running at over 500Mbps.",youtube,1,Airtel
15,"n Bangalore’s IT hub, Whitefield, 5G is not available everywhere, only in some patches.""",youtube,-1,Airtel
16,"When I forced LTE to NR only, I didn’t get it. On top of that, calls keep dropping. So if you don't have a secondary phone like you, forget about 5G, guys. Of note, as you mentioned before, I’ve noticed that NetMonstar does the best speed test with perfect location selection.",youtube,-1,Airtel

18,"Bro, understand the point after watching the whole video. I get 5G in my area too, but sometimes it suddenly switches to 4G because it’s not stable yet, and it will take time, and we also need to be patient. I asked because I saw the option for 5G/4G/2G in Force LTE, but not for 5G only, so how did Utsav ji get that? And mind you, if you do this, you won’t be able to make calls because VoNR isn’t available, and every call is made via VoLTE, meaning 4G, as Utsav ji mentioned.",youtube,1,Airtel

21,"""I’ve been using both Jio and Airtel’s 5G for a few days... Jio True5G is always connected, so it’s good  and also stable in Hisar city, Haryana. But Airtel 5G + is actually - because it doesn't connect well, disconnects frequently, and I have to turn Airplane mode on/off to get it back. And who knows, it might still disconnect. Airtel 5G might disappear after taking two steps forward and then reappear, but Jio 5G is the best indoors/outdoors EVERYWHERE. ",youtube,1,Airtel

23,"Try putting your SIM in a supported device. Once your SIM gets 5G in that phone, put the SIM back in your phone.
